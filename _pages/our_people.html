          Leora Mosman (she/her) joined the Resilient Advocates Collective in
          September 2023 as a contract production and operations assistant. She
          has over four years experience providing pro se legal support, direct
          services, and case management for detained asylum seekers and
          refugees. She also has experience in facilitation, training, corporate
          research for divestment campaigns, and community organizing. She is an
          aspiring artist and abolitionist.

          Leora grew up on Tongva land, and now lives on the colonized land of
          the Wolof, Serer, and Peuhl people in a region from where indigenous
          Africans were kidnapped and stolen by enslavers - also known as
          Senegal. Leora acknowledges that her privileges, and the ease with
          which her passport lets her navigate arbitrary international borders,
          are due to these intersecting and ongoing genocides against Black and
          Indigenous people, both in her home "country" and globally.​

          Whitney Knox Lee (she/her) is a black mother to black children, an
          anti-racism and DEI educator, an attorney, and podcast host. Whitney
          joined the Resilient Advocates Collective in December 2023 and
          co-leads network development and consulting opportunities. Whitney has
          a sincere interest in promoting anti-racism, racial equity, and
          inclusion in the law, in the workplace and beyond. To this end,
          Whitney works as a consultant to law firms across the country to teach
          principles of anti-racism and racial justice advocacy to advocates,
          and to help foster cultural humility and inclusivity within the
          workplace and amongst legal professionals. Whitney has spent a
          majority of her professional life working for non-profit agencies.
          Most recently Whitney worked as a civil rights attorney to end mass
          incarceration and to improve access to medical care for incarcerated
          individuals in Georgia and Alabama. Prior to this, Whitney worked for
          seven years as a legal services attorney in the areas of
          landlord/tenant law, disability and public benefits, and family law.

          Whitney’s podcast, Impostrix Podcast, is an outlet for Whitney’s
          passion of bringing race equity in the workplace to fruition. The show
          aims to empower professionals of color to successfully navigate
          imposter treatment and racial toxicity in the workplace with the
          ultimate goal of creating community, unearthing collective power, and
          preparing to lead.

          Whitney occupies unceded land of the Muscogee people, and land through
          which Muscogee walked, cried, and died on the trail of tears, now
          known as Atlanta metropolitan area. Whitney acknowledges the privilege
          this genocide affords her and the communities inhabiting this land.
